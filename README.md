🚀 Astro Cat - Cross-Platform Edition (v1.3)
Welcome to the ultimate version of Astro Cat! What started as a simple P2P browser game has evolved into a full-fledged, cross-platform multiplayer experience with cloud saves, native Android support, a virtual economy, and strict session security.

✨ Key Features
🎮 Cross-Platform Play: Runs seamlessly on Desktop Web, Mobile Browsers, and as a Native Android App (APK/AAB).

🔐 Smart Authentication: Google Sign-In powered by Firebase. Uses Popup for Desktop and Redirect for Mobile/Native. Includes a strict Session Locking System to prevent multi-device overlapping.

☁️ Cloud Saving: Player profiles, high scores, coins, lives, and inventory (skins/backgrounds) are synced in real-time using Firestore.

⚔️ Real-Time Multiplayer (PvP): 1v1 online racing using Node.js and Socket.io with server-managed room codes.

💰 Virtual Economy & Shop: Collect coins during gameplay or watch AdMob Rewarded Video Ads to purchase retro skins and cosmic backgrounds.

⚡ Energy System: Players have a maximum of 5 lives. Lives regenerate automatically over a 4-hour background timer.

📱 Responsive HUD: Dynamic user interface utilizing CSS clamp() and flexbox to fit perfectly on any screen size or orientation.

🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack
Frontend: React 18, Vite, HTML5 Canvas, Web Audio API.

Backend (Real-time): Node.js, Express, Socket.io.

Database & Auth (BaaS): Firebase (Authentication, Firestore).

Mobile Engine: Capacitor JS.

Monetization: Google AdMob (@capacitor-community/admob).

🛠️ Quick Start & Installation
1. Prerequisites
Node.js (v18+ recommended)

A Firebase Project (with Google Auth and Firestore enabled)

Android Studio (only if building the mobile app)

2. Environment Setup
Create a .env file inside the client/ directory and add your Firebase and Socket URLs:

VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_https://www.google.com/search?q=project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_https://www.google.com/search?q=project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

3. Running Locally
Start the Backend Server:
cd server
npm install
npm start
(Server runs on http://localhost:3000)

Start the React Frontend:
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
(Game runs on http://localhost:5173)

📱 Building the Native Android App (APK/AAB)
This project uses Capacitor to bridge the web game to a native Android environment.

Build the production web assets:
cd client
npm run build

Sync the built web assets and plugins to the Android project:
npx cap sync android

Open the project in Android Studio to build the signed APK or App Bundle (.aab):
npx cap open android

Note: Ensure your versionCode and versionName are updated in android/app/build.gradle before releasing to the Google Play Console.

🐛 Troubleshooting
Mobile Browser Login Fails: Ensure your production domain (e.g., https://www.google.com/search?q=astro-cat.onrender.com) is added to the Authorized domains list in your Firebase Authentication settings.

"Account played on another device" Error: This is the Session Locking system at work. If a session gets stuck during development, manually change the isOnline field to false for that user in your Firestore database.

AdMob Not Showing on Web: The game is designed to run a "Fake 3-second Ad" on web browsers to maintain the user experience. Native AdMob videos will only trigger when running inside the compiled Android App.
